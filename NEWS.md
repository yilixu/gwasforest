    + Now user can flip the input value of meta study for calculating exp(Value) and confidence interval; e.g. when meta beta is < 0, let's say -0.5, setting **flipMeta** = TRUE will let downstream calculation use -(meta beta), which is -(-0.5) = 0.5, or vice versa.
    + Now forest plot reference line on the non-exponentiated scale is more sensible.
